      "The loan eligibility evaluation process involves several factors. Here's a breakdown of how we'll approach this:\n",

      "1.  **Income and Employment:** The customer's net salary (21000) is a positive indicator of financial stability.\n",
      "2.  **Bank Statement Summary:** The \"salary_credits_consistent\" flag indicates consistent salary credits, which is a good sign.\n",
      "3.  **Score:** The score of 645 suggests a good creditworthiness.\n",
      "4.  **DPM (Current Demand Probability):** The DPM of 1 indicates a low probability of default.\n",
      "5.  **Unsecured Loans:** The presence of 2 unsecured loans suggests a willingness to take on risk.\n",
      "6.  **Inquiries:** The number of inquiries (3) is a positive signal, indicating potential monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these factors, the overall assessment is favorable.  The underwriting decision is \"Approved\" because the combination of factors suggests a strong likelihood of loan approval. The reasoning provides a clear explanation for the decision.\n",
